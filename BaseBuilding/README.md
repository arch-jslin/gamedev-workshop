# Base building
Create a base building prototype in Unity.

Users should be able to build a base from rooms and corridors in a variety of layouts. Have a look at [base building in Subnautica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-oa3bzir9A) as well as [base building in No Man's Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpsSJrh5WzY&t=165) for inspiration.

The problem is open-ended by design. There is no right or wrong approach. Feel free to make technical and creative decisions that feel right to you.

## Gameplay
The user is able to construct, deconstruct, enter, and walk around inside bases.

## Building blocks
The user can choose between two basic building blocks.
- Room with four doors, one on each side.
- Straight corridor with two doors, one on each end.

## Construction process
The user can place building blocks on the ground or attach them to an existing base. Pieces snap together when they connect. Connecting one piece to another removes any doors between them.

It is impossible to place pieces so that they intersect each other. The user is given visual feedback on whether or not the placement of a piece in a particular position is allowed.

# Submissions
In order to participate, send me the link to the GitHub repository of your solution. By participating you agree to have your code reviewed by me in front of an audience. The goal is for all of us to learn something in the process.

# Code reviews
Code review sessions will be broadcast live in the [IGDShare Discord](https://discord.gg/FNkHgBN) and hopefully recorded on YouTube for future reference.

# Translations

If you find this workshop useful and speak another language, I'd very much appreciate any help translating the chapters. Clone the repository, add a localized copy of the `README.md`, for example `README-pt-BR.md`, and send me a pull request.
