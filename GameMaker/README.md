# Game Maker

Create a small Unity game where users can create and play their own games.

In _Create_ mode users can create entity prefabs and place instances of them in the scene. In _Play_ mode users can play the created scene and interact with the placed entities.

The problem is open-ended by design. There is no right or wrong approach. Feel free to make technical and creative decisions that feel right to you.

## Create mode

The user can choose between two types of entities.
- Cube
- Sphere

The user can add behaviors to the entity. Provide these two behaviors:
- Explode
- Give points

The user can save an entity as a prefab. Multiple prefabs can be created this way.
The user can place one or more instances of an entity prefab in the scene. Think of the scene as a simple level.

## Play mode

In _Play_ mode, the user can click or tap on any instance of the entity in the scene to trigger the attached behaviors.

# Submissions

In order to participate, send me the link to the GitHub repository of your solution. By participating you agree to have your code reviewed by me in front of an audience. The goal is for all of us to learn something in the process.

# Code reviews

Code review sessions will be broadcast live in the [IGDShare Discord](https://discord.gg/FNkHgBN) and hopefully recorded on YouTube for future reference.
